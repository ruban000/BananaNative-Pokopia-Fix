"""Fire Emblem Fortune's Weave v131072 (main db93b0125f4850601d61c3edde012f8e).

VARIANT_CUTS['43']: a native 4:3 mod (game.tsv `variant 43`, the launcher's Game settings › Aspect ratio). The game keeps its 16:9
window and scene sizes; its cameras take a 4:3 aspect and its UI is laid out for 4:3 inside the 16:9 frame, which the present then
shows at 4:3 (DM_VK_PICTURE_ASPECT=4:3: it fills a 4:3 screen and gets side bars on a 16:9 one). The words started as a .pchtxt
for Eden-family emulators (camera aspect, ui2d pane rules) and were extended here; each group below says what it fixes. The
original bytes are kept so the rewriter refuses another executable."""

# Minimap rotation: v11 pinned N_RotCenter's Z rotation (+0x44) at 180 degrees, taking the game's turning of the map with the camera for a
# fault. The game places the quest pins (N_Quest, outside N_RotCenter) with its own angle, so they slid across the pinned map while walking and
# turning, and the map was the wrong way round for the camera. N_RotCenter now only skips the pane rules (0x58f570) and keeps its rotation;
# the scissor fix below keeps the turning map inside its frame. Checked in Dagsion against 16:9 through a walk and a camera turn.
# Camera aspect and ui2d pane rules (v11). The ui2d rules: a pane at |y| >= 120 under a parent at global (0,0) moves 180 units toward
# the nearer top or bottom edge (the "edge rule"), a centred full-screen pane (>= 1896 x 960) gets its y scaled by 4/3 (the
# "overlay rule"), sliding 30x40 containers count as anchored; a few names are exempt (L_UnitIn*, L_Cursor*, L_Popup_*).

# v12 UI fixes, with the v11 entry words at 0x57f048 and 0x58faac above redirected:

# - L_List: v10's full-screen overlay rule (centred pane >= 1896x960 gets y scale x4/3) caught the Base Menu's 2694x1120 list container;
#   the game places the menu cursor at (target global - parent global) without the parent's scale, so the cursor drifted further below
#   the selected entry with every step down. Panes whose name starts with L_Li are now left unscaled (caves 0x5a18a4, 0x5a3c84).
# - A_Contents: v4's HUD rule (|y| >= 120 under a parent at (0,0) moves 180 units toward the edge) moved dialog text (T_Text at y 180 in
#   A_Contents) out of its window ("You cannot fast-travel at this time." above the box). Children of A_Contents are now left in place
#   (caves 0x5a4544, 0x5a6864). Both found by reading the live pane trees in a PC emulator and verified there.

# v22: travel map spot info (Gmap_UI: N_SpotDetail > L_SpotDetail, 2548x1395, holding Gmap_UI_SpotDetail's Bg, N_Img and N_Info at y 540).
# v10's overlay rule stretched L_SpotDetail 4/3 tall and v4's edge rule moved its children, so the info text, the level pills and the ore list
# came out tall and off the top while the dark backdrop (Bg, sized by the game to N_DummyMargin's global y against a hard 540, the 16:9 top
# edge) stopped short and the ore list spilled below it. L_SpotDe* is now left unscaled by the overlay rule (cave 0x5d66a4, after v18's UnitPub
# check), and the backdrop sizing uses 720, the 4:3 top edge (0x168ed78). Checked on the device at Dagsion and Niraga Mine against 16:9.
# v23: quest panels (Common_Quest, Common_QuestTalk: L_Info 1634x1096; Common_TutorialMenu: L_Info 1766x1080). The overlay rule caught them
# as full-screen (>= 1080 tall) and stretched them 4/3, so the quest offer, the Quest List and the tutorials looked tall. A pane named exactly
# L_Info is now left unscaled and moved 180 up, so its top meets the 4:3 top as the list beside it does (caves 0x5d7de4, 0x5d7988; the move
# ends the rules for the pane, as v19's Fade does, or the edge rule would move it again). Checked on the Quest List and the Tutorials.
