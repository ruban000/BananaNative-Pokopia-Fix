# Movies

The SDK's movie library (`movie::Decoder`, `movie::Extractor`), which the host takes over in `dm/host/hle_movie.c`, and the games' movie players. Each entry: symptom, cause, fix, the games it was found on. The [symptom index](../agents/symptoms.md) lists every symptom.

## Decoder lifecycle

### The SDK's hardware decoder opens nvdrv

- **Symptom:** abort in NVIDIA's video path (`NvRmChannelOpen` → `NvOsDrvOpen`).
- **Cause:** the SDK movie library's hardware decoder opens nvdrv directly.
- **Fix:** the host takes over `movie::Decoder` (`hle_movie.c`, [`movie::Decoder` taken over as a MediaCodec-style protocol](#moviedecoder-taken-over-as-a-mediacodec-style-protocol)); nvdrv opens fail (`hle_nvdrv.c`).

### `movie::Decoder` taken over as a MediaCodec-style protocol

- **Symptom:** the game waits forever at a movie (Engage's 94 s opening `S01F.webm`; frames keep presenting, nothing happens).
- **Cause:** Unity demuxes the WebM itself and feeds VP9 packets to `movie::Decoder`; with no working decoder the movie never ends.
- **Fix:** `movie::Decoder` is a thin wrapper over Android's MediaCodec, and its vtable entries are symbol relocations, so `HLE_FORCE` on each method also catches Unity's virtual calls. The host implements the protocol: four `nn::os` events (`DecoderEvents` = input available, output ready, format changed, error), input indices (`AcquireInputBufferIndex`, none = 0x1011; `GetInputBuffer` fills the client's `movie::Buffer`; `SendInputBufferForDecode(index, offset, size, µs, flags)`), output indices (`AcquireOutputBufferIndex`, none = 0x100e; one NV12 frame per packet copied into the buffer Unity allocated, w × h × 1.5; `ReleaseOutputBufferIndex`). `Buffer`, `MediaData` and events are handled through the SDK's own exported functions (`SetDataAndCapacity`, `SetRange`, `SetInt32`, `SetRect`, `SignalEvent`). Unity reads `width`, `height`, `crop`, `nv12-y-stride`, `nv12-y-offset`, `nv12-uv-offset` and `slice-height`. The guest thread that sends a packet or returns an output index waits for the decode and signals the events itself, because `SignalEvent` is guest code and cannot run on a host thread.
- **Found on:** [Fire Emblem Engage](../../dm/games/0100A6301214E000/README.md): when the movie ends the game continues to its title screen.
- **Note:** output slots, VP9 decoding and the output format keys are in their own entries ([Packets wait while every output slot is taken](#packets-wait-while-every-output-slot-is-taken), [VP9 on host threads with libvpx](#vp9-on-host-threads-with-libvpx), [Output format keys (`md_format`)](#output-format-keys-md_format)).

### Output format keys (`md_format`)

- **Symptom:** a movie in grey with vertical bands of colour, its luma sharp; or a read far outside guest memory at `main+0x344f74` on the first movie picture (CRI Sofdec2's NV12 → RGB conversion).
- **Cause:** the host never set `nv12-uv-stride` in the output format (Unity reads `nv12-uv-offset` only). CRIWARE's Sofdec hands its VP9 video to `movie::Decoder` in mode 1, NV12 into its own buffers, and draws the planes with its shaders; it reads `nv12-uv-stride` from the output format, and the bands were the top row's chroma: every chroma row was read from the first one. Catherine's Sofdec2 sends its H.264 through `movie::Decoder`, mode 1, output format 4; the player reads `nv12-y-stride`, `nv12-y-offset`, `nv12-uv-stride` and `nv12-uv-offset` from the output format and checks none of the results (`main+0x34e694`), so the chroma stride was stack garbage.
- **Fix:** the host now sets everything the SDK's `DecoderImpl::GetOutputBufferFormatFromDecoder` (SDK 19 `subsdk0+0x121f50`) does: also `nv12-uv-stride`, the luma (Y) stride as for any NV12 picture, `nv12-width` and `nv12-height` (`md_format` in `hle_movie.c`).
- **Found on:** [DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined](../../dm/games/0100A9D01C446000/README.md) (the grey picture); [Catherine: Full Body](../../dm/games/0100BF00112C0000/README.md) (SDK 8.2.1, CRI middleware; one boot: the crash).

### SDK 4's `movie::Decoder` constructor without a priority

- **Symptom:** a call through a null pointer in the host's `movie::Decoder::Configure` right after `nnMain` starts the logos.
- **Cause:** SDK 4's `Decoder` constructor has no priority argument (`_ZN5movie7DecoderC1ENS_11DecoderTypeENS_19DecoderOutputFormatENS_11DecoderModeE`). The host took over only the four-argument one, so the SDK built its own decoder and the host's `Configure` read that object as its own.
- **Fix:** both forms are taken over now (`hle_movie.c`).
- **Found on:** [DARK SOULS: REMASTERED](../../dm/games/01004AB00A260000/README.md) (SDK 4.5.0; one boot).

### SDK 3's `movie::Decoder` constructor takes a type and a format only

- **Symptom:** a call through a null pointer in the host's `movie::Decoder::Configure` (`pc=0 lr=h_movie_Configure+…`) when the first movie starts; with only the constructor taken over, `[RED] movie: decoder type 1 output 3 mode 1 not supported by the host`.
- **Cause:** SDK 3.5.1's constructor is `Decoder(DecoderType, DecoderOutputFormat)` (`_ZN5movie7DecoderC1ENS_11DecoderTypeENS_19DecoderOutputFormatE`, `subsdk1+0x2de630`: it builds `DecoderImpl(type, format)`), a third form after [SDK 4's](#sdk-4s-moviedecoder-constructor-without-a-priority): the SDK built its own decoder, as on SDK 4. That SDK has no decoder mode: its decoders work on the CPU. And its output formats are numbered one lower than later SDKs': `DecoderImpl` keeps the format at +0xdc and the type at +0xe0, `ConvertDecoderOutputFormat` (`subsdk1+0x2dd16c`) converts format 2 to ARGB and copies format 3 out as NV12 with stride = width, the UV rows right after the Y rows, and `GetOutputBufferSize` (`subsdk1+0x2dcde8`) gives w × h × 4 for 2 and w × h × 1.5 for 3; format 1 is PCM16 as later. Its `GetOutputBufferSize` also puts 0x20, an alignment, in the second output, where SDK 4 and later put the decoder mode (Metroid Dread `subsdk0+0x11f308`: `str w8,[x2]` with the mode, 1 for the CPU).
- **Fix:** the two-argument constructor is taken over as a CPU-mode decoder (mode 1) with format 3 as NV12 and 2 as ABGR (`h_movie_Decoder3` in `hle_movie.c`), and its decoders report 0x20 as `GetOutputBufferSize`'s second output (`out_align`). The host's NV12 already has the SDK 3 layout (`md_nv12`).
- **Found on:** [Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition](../../dm/games/0100AE00096EA000/README.md) (SDK 3.5.1, H.264 MP4 movies through its own player): the title's background and the opening movie play.

### The complete-object destructor

- **Cause:** the game calls the complete-object destructor `movie::Decoder::~Decoder` (`D1`); the SDK's own one destroyed the host object as a `DecoderImpl`.
- **Fix:** the host now takes it over too.
- **Found on:** [Metroid Dread](../../dm/games/010093801237C000/README.md).

### Client events read through the registered pointer

- **Symptom:** the first deferred signal crashed in `InternalCriticalSectionImplByHorizon::Enter` (DRAGON QUEST XI S).
- **Cause:** `RegisterClientEvents` copied the four event pointers, because Dread's struct had been overwritten by its second movie. DRAGON QUEST XI S (Unreal's Switch movie player, VP9 with 6-channel Vorbis) does the opposite: it registers its struct right after constructing the decoder (`main+0x39edab0`, through the decoder's vtable) and fills it later, so the copy held leftovers (`0xe00000010`). The SDK keeps only the pointer (`DecoderImpl::RegisterClientEvents` stores it at +0xd0) and reads the entry each time it signals, skipping a null one (`SendOutputBufferEventAvailableToClient` and the others, `subsdk0+0x1feb0`).
- **Fix:** the host now does the same (`md_event` in `hle_movie.c`). When the client's entry is not a readable, 8-byte aligned pointer, it falls back to the entry's value at registration if that was one (Dread's case), and otherwise logs a red line.
- **Found on:** [Metroid Dread](../../dm/games/010093801237C000/README.md); [DRAGON QUEST XI S](../../dm/games/01006C300E9F0000/README.md).

### `Flush`, `Stop` and `Start`

- **Fix:** as with MediaCodec, `Flush` announces nothing, and no input or output index is handed out while the decoder is stopped. The "input available" after `Start` is signalled about 2 ms later from a guest thread, as the SDK's codec thread would. Pending signals are dropped at `Stop`, `Flush` and destruction.
- **Found on:** [Metroid Dread](../../dm/games/010093801237C000/README.md): the game ends a movie with `Flush`, `Flush`, `Stop`, destroy, and calls `Start` after a `Flush` when it loops.

### Input indices returned by a flush while a client holds them

- **Symptom:** the process dies when an activity starts, 2 runs in 5, with no `CRASH` line: the run ends with exit 137 (SIGKILL), and `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/dmhost-*.ips` has `EXC_BREAKPOINT` in `_os_unfair_lock_corruption_abort` ← `pthread_mutex_destroy` ← `md_free` (the movie decoder's destructor).
- **Cause:** each activity's preview is an H.264 movie (`movie/Movie/*.mp4`) the game loops with Flush and Start, from four threads at once (`DM_MOVIE_TRACE=1` logs every decoder call with its thread). Its event thread acquired an input index while the control thread's Flush waited for the packet being decoded; the flush then returned that index to the free list, it was handed out a second time, two packets shared one buffer (VideoToolbox -12909 on the overwritten one, in exactly the runs that died), and a fifth pending packet wrote past `pend[]` into the decoder's `npend` and `dmu`.
- **Fix** (`hle_movie.c`): a send now claims an index a flush returned, and `pend[]` cannot overflow. Handing such an index out last was not enough (with three hosts running at once one run still sent an index twice): an index the client held across a flush is now withheld for 250 ms unless the client sends it first, and an acquire refused only for that announces input when the first one comes back, so a client that abandons its indices, as MediaCodec's rules expect, loses none.
- **Found on:** [Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain](../../dm/games/0100620012D6E000/README.md) (SDK 11.4.3, its activity previews).

### End of stream is the last input until `Flush` or `Stop`

- **Symptom:** when the prologue movie was skipped, 2.25 GB were mapped within seconds, past the application pool, and the game crashed in its allocator (DRAGON QUEST XI S).
- **Cause:** DRAGON QUEST XI S's movie player sends an end-of-stream packet (length 0, time 0) for every input it gets once its extractor is done, until the game stops the movie. Each one became an end-of-stream output that the player turned into an audio sample.
- **Fix:** also as with MediaCodec, an input marked end-of-stream is the last until `Flush` / `Stop`: no input index is handed out or announced after it (`in_eos` in `hle_movie.c`).
- **Found on:** [Metroid Dread](../../dm/games/010093801237C000/README.md) (movie sub-list); [DRAGON QUEST XI S](../../dm/games/01006C300E9F0000/README.md).

### End-of-stream packets with no data, and deleted decoders

- **Symptom:** decoding the end-of-stream packet gave VideoToolbox −12909 and AudioToolbox −50.
- **Cause:** the game ends a stream with time −1 and the whole 4 MB input buffer as its length: that packet carries no data. It also deletes its decoders (`D0`).
- **Fix:** for `D0` the host frees the object with the game's `operator delete` after its own state.
- **Found on:** [Monster Hunter Rise](../../dm/games/0100B04011742000/README.md).

### H.264 drain at the end of a stream goes on with released slots

- **Symptom:** the game never leaves a movie that has played to its end; the last picture stays on screen.
- **Cause:** `DM_MOVIE_TRACE=1`: the end-of-stream packet came with H.264 pictures still in the reorder queue, its output went out as a black picture without the end-of-stream flag, and the queued pictures were to follow one per free output slot (the drain). Unity held all 16 video slots by then. `ReleaseOutputBufferIndex` decoded again only when packets were queued, and none were, so the drain never went on: no flag, and the game waited for the movie's end for good.
- **Fix:** a released slot now goes on with a drain too, and the end-of-stream packet's own output takes the first queued picture (`jflush`), so no black picture shows before a movie's last frames (`hle_movie.c`).
- **Found on:** [AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES](../../dm/games/010089B00D09C000/README.md) (Unity 2017.4: the 6 s Spike Chunsoft logo `StreamingAssets/Movie/al_titel_cl_sc_1k_30.mp4`, H.264 High, before the title).
- **Note:** the audio decoder was never affected: AAC has no reorder queue.

### H.264 loops retain presentation order when timestamps restart

- **Symptom:** a looping tutorial loses B-frame presentation order after the first loop, without a `Flush` or end-of-stream packet.
- **Cause:** the reorder queue sorted every picture by PTS alone. When the next loop restarted PTS at its IDR, the previous loop's high-PTS tail stayed behind the new pictures and occupied their reorder lookahead.
- **Fix:** `hle_movie_avc.c` identifies an IDR once per access unit and tags the synchronous decode callback with its coded-sequence number. The queue sorts by sequence, then PTS; pictures from a completed sequence can leave without waiting for more lookahead. The current sequence retains its existing depth, EOS drains all pictures, and `Flush` discards the queue and resets sequence tracking. PTS values are unchanged.
- **Found on:** [Super Mario Odyssey](../../dm/games/0100000000010000/README.md), reported with source by zatteogit in [issue #889](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative/issues/889). The synthetic `t_movie_avc` regression feeds both Annex B and length-prefixed packets through the production parser and callback wiring, checking distinct picture identities over repeated loops, short sequences, Flush and EOS. It substitutes decompression. Separately, x264 B-frame clips (a single IDR with 3 or 1 B-frames, and 12-frame GOPs) looped three times through real VideoToolbox had 123 of 180 pictures in the wrong position before the fix and none after. Gameplay and playback rate were not checked on this code; the reporter's replay of the game's tracks and gameplay test ran on a modified local checkout. The existing fixed reorder depth and IDR `no_output_of_prior_pics_flag` handling are unchanged.

### No picture carries the end-of-stream flag

- **Symptom:** an anime or story movie ends on a black screen; the pause menu still works and skipping lets the game continue.
- **Cause:** at the end of an H.264 stream the host put the end-of-stream flag on the last picture of its reorder queue. CRI Sofdec2 drops an output flagged end-of-stream without showing it and waits for the picture it counted on: the movie never completes. Catherine's anime intro had 1,140 of its 1,141 pictures delivered, the last only with flag 4. The queue held pictures there for no reason too: `hle_movie_avc.c` held four for every non-Baseline stream, assuming B-frames, but Catherine's High-profile streams use SPS `pic_order_cnt_type = 2`, whose output order is the decode order (H.264 8.2.1.3).
- **Fix:** the drain hands out every queued picture without the flag, then one output without a picture carries it, with the end-of-stream packet's time (`md_pump` in `hle_movie.c`), as VP9 and Baseline streams whose end-of-stream packet has no data already ended. This holds for every H.264 stream, with or without B-frames. Separately, `avc_reorder_depth` reads the SPS through `pic_order_cnt_type` (emulation-prevention bytes removed, the High-profile chroma fields and scaling lists skipped): POC type 2 needs no reorder queue in any profile; other POC types keep a depth of 4 (0 for Baseline), as does an SPS cut short. No timeout or movie skip is involved; the intro delivers all 1,141 pictures and goes on to Golden Playhouse by itself.
- **Found on:** [Catherine: Full Body](../../dm/games/0100BF00112C0000/README.md) (1.0.1a, CRI Sofdec2, H.264 High, NV12).
- **Check:** `t_movie_avc` (`dm/host/tests`) runs the drain through `md_pump` with synthetic pictures, with all output slots free and with two, and checks the SPS reader (POC types, scaling lists, chroma formats, truncated input). The game's `smoke.tsv` lets its intro finish without a skip press. On the Mac from a fresh save, the host before this fix never closed the intro's decoder in 180 s; the drain alone (with the old reorder depth of 4) and the drain with POC type 2's depth of 0 both had all 1,141 pictures out and the decoder closed, and the latter's screenshot shows Golden Playhouse.
- **Open:** CRI hands the decoder zero timestamps, so the reorder queue, sorted by time, cannot reorder a CRI stream that has B-frames; none has been found yet. Catherine's later story movies and its movies on the iPhone have not been checked one by one.

## Output slots

### Output slot counts per decoder kind

A decoder hands out as many outputs as it has slots, and while every slot is taken it takes no input ([Packets wait while every output slot is taken](#packets-wait-while-every-output-slot-is-taken)). The counts now (`hle_movie.c`): `MD_NOUT` 64 for a Vorbis decoder (the most any decoder has), `MD_NOUT_AAC` 32 for AAC and `MD_NOUT_VIDEO` 16 for video; a slot is allocated when first used. Every decoder had 8 at first. The entries below raised them one game at a time, and each gives the counts of its time: audio 32 ([Audio decoders keep more outputs than a pre-decoding player fills](#audio-decoders-keep-more-outputs-than-a-pre-decoding-player-fills)), audio 64 ([Audio output slots for players that hold every output](#audio-output-slots-for-players-that-hold-every-output)), video 16 ([Video output slots: how far the extractor gets ahead](#video-output-slots-how-far-the-extractor-gets-ahead)) and AAC 32 ([AAC decoders offer at most 32 outputs](#aac-decoders-offer-at-most-32-outputs)).

### Packets wait while every output slot is taken

- **Fix:** while every output slot is taken, packets wait and their input indices are not returned, as with MediaCodec; dropping them instead lost frames.
- **Found on:** [Fire Emblem Engage](../../dm/games/0100A6301214E000/README.md).

### Audio decoders keep more outputs than a pre-decoding player fills

- **Symptom:** the opening movie never starts, in about half the boots (DRAGON QUEST XI S: a black screen and no sound from boot on).
- **Cause:** Square Enix's `UMediaPlayer` has two natives of its own, `StartPreDecoding` and `IsPreDecodingCompleted`. The opening's Blueprint polls the second once a frame and only then plays its Matinee, whose event key calls `Play`. Its Switch player (vtable `main+0x77921b8`, `IsPreDecodingCompleted` at `main+0x42d4d20`) is complete when every selected track has at least one decoded output queued. The player starts its clock and its decoders on the first `TickInput` after `StartPreDecoding`. The render thread's first fetch (`main+0x39f07d0`, the `+0x5c7` flag) takes every decoded picture and shows the newest. The host decoded all eight video outputs (to 236 ms) within 36 ms. Each Vorbis decoder's 8 outputs were full by then, because nothing consumes audio before `Play`, so the extractor waited for an audio input and no picture followed the ones the render thread took. The movie started only when the game thread's poll came between the first decoded picture and that fetch.
- **Fix:** audio decoders then kept 32 outputs (`MD_NOUT`) and video decoders 8, so video keeps flowing after the first fetch. Since then audio decoders have 64 (Monster Train 2), AAC ones 32 (`MD_NOUT_AAC`, Mario vs. Donkey Kong) and video ones 16 (`MD_NOUT_VIDEO`, Animal Crossing: New Horizons); see [Output slot counts per decoder kind](#output-slot-counts-per-decoder-kind).
- **Found on:** [DRAGON QUEST XI S](../../dm/games/01006C300E9F0000/README.md): 8 boots out of 8 start; [Monster Train 2](../../dm/games/010051701FB46000/README.md) (64).
- **Note:** to find such a gate: probe the player's `SetRate` (`DM_PROBE=main:<off>`) to see whether the game ever asks to play, then follow the Blueprint native that calls it (the `FNameNativePtrPair` tables give the names).

### Audio output slots for players that hold every output

- **Symptom:** a movie stays black after its first picture, the sound never starts, and the game keeps presenting frames.
- **Cause:** the player takes every output a decoder offers and starts playing only once it holds about half a second of audio. The host then gave each decoder 8 output slots (before DRAGON QUEST XI S's 32 for audio) and takes input only while one is free (as MediaCodec does). `DM_MOVIE_TRACE=1` (each line now names the decoder): Unity held all 8 audio outputs, the audio decoder kept the next 4 packets and handed out no input index, the video packets behind them in the file never came, and the video decoder had given out one picture (the host releases H.264 pictures once more than 4 are queued).
- **Fix:** slot counts per decoder kind, measured: 8 audio / 8 video and 8 audio / 32 video hang; 64 audio / 8 video plays, starting with 27 audio and 8 video outputs held (peak 30 audio). 32 audio slots hold that peak with two to spare, so audio decoders got 64 (`MD_NOUT`; a PCM slot is 128 KB, allocated when first used), and video kept 8 (`MD_NOUT_VIDEO`: a 1080p picture is 3 MB, 8 MB as RGBA).
- **Found on:** [Monster Train 2](../../dm/games/010051701FB46000/README.md) (its 90 s intro, `StreamingAssets/intro_fmv.mp4`: H.264 High with 2 reorder frames and AAC interleaved packet by packet, played by Unity 2022.3's movie player: `movie::Extractor` in `subsdk0` feeds both decoders from one thread in file order). The game's A, B and + do not skip this intro.
- **Note:** later changes: video decoders have 16 slots ([Video output slots: how far the extractor gets ahead](#video-output-slots-how-far-the-extractor-gets-ahead)) and AAC decoders 32 ([AAC decoders offer at most 32 outputs](#aac-decoders-offer-at-most-32-outputs)); Vorbis keeps 64. `hle_movie.c` now has `MD_NOUT` 64, `MD_NOUT_AAC` 32, `MD_NOUT_VIDEO` 16.

### Video output slots: how far the extractor gets ahead

- **Symptom:** a movie shows as a black screen with the loading icon, one picture every few seconds, while its sound decoder keeps up.
- **Cause:** this player also holds every output it is offered (16 of 16 video, 59 of 64 audio), so how far its extractor can get ahead of the picture on screen is the video slots plus the 4 queued packets. With 8 video slots that was 0.4 s, and the audio behind the next video packet, whose clock the player follows, ran dry: 86 pictures in 25 s. With 16 or 32 slots all 1,960 play at 30 fps.
- **Fix:** a video decoder now has 16 (`MD_NOUT_VIDEO`); a slot is allocated when first used, so the 8 more cost 24 MB of NV12 at 1080p only in a player that holds them all.
- **Found on:** [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](../../dm/games/01006F8002326000/README.md) (the in-flight movie `Movie/OpeningMovie.webm`, VP9 1080p and Vorbis through `movie::Extractor`).

### AAC decoders offer at most 32 outputs

- **Symptom:** a crash in the game's heap free (`sead::ExpHeap`) on a movie thread, a second into the first movie, at the same address every boot (`pc=main+0x42f980`, a free-list unlink through a link of 0x3f, `addr=0x47`).
- **Cause:** the game's movie player keeps the outputs it holds in a ring of 32 entries {u32 output index, u32 flags, u64 time} per track (`main+0xe93d4c`: 0x200 bytes) and pushes with no bounds check (`main+0xe94140`), and the host's audio decoder offered 64 outputs, so the 33rd outstanding one, index 63, went past the ring. The console's AAC decoder cannot offer more than 32, or the game would overflow there too.
- **Fix:** AAC decoders now have 32 outputs (`MD_NOUT_AAC`; Monster Train 2 peaked at 30 held), Vorbis keeps 64.
- **Found on:** [Mario vs. Donkey Kong](../../dm/games/0100B99019412000/README.md) (1.0.1, SDK 15.3.0: its opening movie `Movie/Cutscene01.mp4`, H.264 and AAC through `movie::Extractor`).
- **Check:** `DM_PROBE_WATCH` on the link broke the movie's file reads (the page also held a 64 KB read buffer, and `read()` into a protected page fails with EFAULT), so the movie stopped and nothing crashed; `DM_PROBE_POLL=<address>+8=3f` (a snapshot only at the change to that value) showed it being written right after the block was relinked, and the values around it were the ring's pairs.

### AAC output buffer size is one frame

- **Symptom:** the movie then froze on its first second, its sound decoder full and the game taking no more audio.
- **Cause:** the player opens an AudioOut of its own (`main+0xe92c2c`), sizes its buffers by the audio decoder's `GetOutputBufferSize`, decodes straight into them (`SetDataAndCapacity` with that size) and appends each whole, advancing its audio clock by size / 4 samples (`main+0xe92a74`). The host answered 128 KB, a bound for any Vorbis packet, so every 4 KB AAC frame played as 0.68 s and the clock crawled (a temporary log of `AppendAudioOutBuffer` showed 131,072-byte buffers).
- **Fix:** an AAC decoder now reports one frame: 1024 samples per channel, 2048 with SBR (object type 5 or 29 in the AudioSpecificConfig), which is what each output holds; Vorbis keeps the bound, its packets vary in length.
- **Found on:** [Mario vs. Donkey Kong](../../dm/games/0100B99019412000/README.md) (1.0.1, the same movie as in [AAC decoders offer at most 32 outputs](#aac-decoders-offer-at-most-32-outputs)).

## Native-texture output

### Decoding into the client's NVN texture

- **Cause:** the decoder is created with output format 3 and mode 2 (`DecoderMode_NativeTexture`). The client's `movie::Buffer` then carries the `NVNtexture` object itself as its data, 8 bytes of capacity (an `RGBX8_SRGB` texture embedded in the game's texture pool entry, `main+0x226c98`), plus `SetNvnDev` / `SetNvnSync`.
- **Fix:** the host converts the VP9 picture to RGBA (BT.709 / BT.601 and range from the stream) and writes it into the texture's storage like `WriteTexels`, then marks the sync as signalled (`nvn_host_write_texture` / `nvn_host_signal_sync` in `hle_nvn.c`). The host writes the texture's block-linear storage on the CPU and the replay layer re-uploads the dirtied pages, as for `WriteTexels` ([nvn-objects.md](nvn-objects.md)).
- **Found on:** [Metroid Dread](../../dm/games/010093801237C000/README.md).

### SDK 4's `movie::Buffer` has no sync object

- **Symptom:** `FATAL movie: missing SDK symbol _ZNK5movie6Buffer10GetNvnSyncEv` at the first frame of the native-texture movie (H.264 into the game's RGBA texture, as in Monster Hunter Rise).
- **Cause:** SDK 4's `movie::Buffer` carries the texture object but no sync object.
- **Fix:** the lookup is optional now; the game reads the texture once `GetOutputBuffer` returns, which the CPU write satisfies.
- **Found on:** [DARK SOULS: REMASTERED](../../dm/games/01004AB00A260000/README.md) (SDK 4.5.0; one boot).

### Parameter sets in `Configure` made the H.264 decoder without RGBA

- **Symptom:** a native-texture movie shows as a strip of small grey copies at the top of the screen.
- **Cause:** the texture held NV12 bytes. In RGBA8, 405 rows of 1920 pixels are exactly a 1920×1080 NV12 frame, rows 0–270 the luma at video black (16) and rows 270–405 the chroma (128). This game's MP4 demuxer hands the parameter sets to `Configure` (`csd-0` / `csd-1`), which made the H.264 decoder there without switching it to RGBA, and the first packet then found it made.
- **Fix:** both paths now go through `md_avc_open` (`hle_movie.c`).
- **Found on:** [Absolum](../../dm/games/0100A83022A22000/README.md) (H.264 logos, FNA3D's `nx_video_player.cpp`: type 1, output 3, mode 2). Monster Hunter Rise's movies never brought parameter sets to `Configure`.

### Last picture kept across a flush and at end of stream

- **Symptom:** looping movie previews flash black at the end of every loop.
- **Cause:** the game reads the buffers of the end-of-stream output (no picture) and of an output it acquired before the flush, and the host painted its texture black for both.
- **Fix** (`hle_movie.c`): a flush now keeps each slot's last picture, and in native-texture mode an output with no picture leaves the texture as it was, as the SDK's GPU consumer has nothing to draw.
- **Found on:** [Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain](../../dm/games/0100620012D6E000/README.md) (the same looped activity previews, Flush and Start).

### `GetOutputBuffer` returns the output index in native-texture mode

- **Symptom:** a native-texture movie freezes on its 16th picture while the game keeps running; `DM_MOVIE_TRACE=1` shows 16 `AcquireOutputBufferIndex` / `GetOutputBuffer` pairs and no `ReleaseOutputBufferIndex`.
- **Cause:** in native-texture mode (output 3, mode 2) the SDK's `DecoderImpl::GetOutputBuffer` calls `CopyOutputBufferToClientTextureAndRelease`, which renders the picture into the client's texture with MediaCodec's `renderOutputBufferAndRelease`: the index goes back to the decoder there, and a client need not release it. The host kept the slot until a release, so a client that never releases held all 16 video slots and the decoder stopped. A client that releases anyway gets success from the SDK, whose texture-mode `ReleaseOutputBufferIndex` turns MediaCodec's "not owned" (-13) into 0 (SDK 17.5.9 `subsdk0+0x123a0c`).
- **Fix** (`hle_movie.c`): the host tracks which output slots the client holds (taken by `AcquireOutputBufferIndex`, returned by a release or a flush). A texture-mode `GetOutputBuffer` returns its slot after writing the texture, and a release of a slot the client does not hold changes nothing and returns 0. Before, such a second release freed a slot the decoder might have filled again.
- **Found on:** [Super Mario Party Jamboree](../../dm/games/0100965017338000/README.md) (SDK 17.5.9: the opening movie and the mode previews). Metroid Dread (SDK 11.4.3) has the same copy-and-release and still releases each index itself, the case the second rule covers.

### A native-texture movie shows a picture 16 frames ahead, then goes back

- **Symptom:** a native-texture movie jumps ahead for one picture and returns: every 17 pictures, each exactly 16 ahead (one cycle of the video output slots), the picture before it never shown. Text burnt into the movie shows the line being typed half a second later for one frame.
- **Cause:** the host returned a native-texture slot inside `GetOutputBuffer` (the entry above), and returning a slot decodes the next queued packet into it within the call and signals the output event. The player's decoder thread acquired the slot again before its output thread's own `ReleaseOutputBufferIndex` for the old picture came, and that release then freed the new picture; the slot was filled once more, a cycle ahead. The SDK returns the index there too, but its hardware decoder fills it later, so the client's release always comes first.
- **Fix** (`hle_movie.c`, `md_rendered`): a slot written into the client's texture is kept until the client releases it, or, for a client that has never released a rendered slot itself (Super Mario Party Jamboree, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond), until its next `GetOutputBuffer`. A decoder learns which kind its client is at the client's first release of a rendered slot; the earlier slots are returned under the same lock that checks them.
- **Found on:** TSUKIHIME -A piece of blue glass moon- (010057A01E4D4000, no profile here; [GitHub issue #700](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative/issues/700): its prologue, a 1080p H.264 movie, `type 1 output 3 mode 2`) and [Metroid Dread](../../dm/games/010093801237C000/README.md#movies), whose movies jumped the same way (15 times in 75 s on the Mac before, none after).

### A BGRA8 client texture gets its movie with red and blue swapped

- **Symptom:** `[RED] movie: client texture format 0x9a is not RGBA8 / RGBX8 (sRGB included), writing in RGBA byte order`; a native-texture movie plays in the wrong colours, warm lamps blue.
- **Cause:** the SDK's consumer draws the decoded picture into the client's texture on the GPU, so it comes out right in any colour format. The host writes the bytes on the CPU, and wrote them in RGBA order whatever the texture's format was.
- **Fix** (`hle_movie.c`, `md_out_tex`): for BGRX8, BGRA8 and their sRGB forms (NVN formats 0x99 to 0x9C), the picture goes through a per-decoder copy with red and blue swapped. The slot's own picture stays RGBA, as a slot can be read twice.
- **Found on:** [TRIANGLE STRATEGY](../../dm/games/0100CC80140F8000/README.md) (the title screen's background movies; BGRA8).

## Demuxers and codecs

### `movie::Extractor` runs natively

- **Symptom:** the game crashed on a null right after the failed open.
- **Cause:** `movie::Extractor` (libwebm in `subsdk0`) runs natively. The host used to force `SetDataSource` to fail because Engage's Unity demuxes by itself.
- **Fix:** the host no longer forces `SetDataSource` to fail.
- **Found on:** [Metroid Dread](../../dm/games/010093801237C000/README.md).

### VP9 on host threads with libvpx

- **Fix:** VP9 packets are decoded with libvpx (`dm/third_party/libvpx`) on one host thread per decoder: guest threads run on the stacks the SDK gives them, too small for libvpx. Packets are decoded in arrival order from one queue.
- **Found on:** [Fire Emblem Engage](../../dm/games/0100A6301214E000/README.md).

### VP8 uses the same libvpx worker and output paths

- **Symptom:** VP8 WebM movies play black; `movie::Decoder` is created with decoder type 2.
- **Cause:** the host offered output slots for VP8 without decoding the packets, and its vendored libvpx included only the VP9 decoder.
- **Fix:** the same libvpx revision now includes its VP8 decoder. Type 2 selects `vpx_codec_vp8_dx`, type 3 selects VP9; both use the existing worker, NV12 conversion and native RGBA output. VP8 keyframe dimensions come from its ten-byte uncompressed header. Only decoded pictures and end-of-stream packets make an output ready.
- **Found on:** [Pokémon Brilliant Diamond](../../dm/games/0100000011D90000/README.md): logos and opening WebM movies. Decoding 3,182 packets over 106 seconds averaged about 1 ms per packet; making the picture visible also needed [zero initialization of depth textures](rendering.md#new-textures-start-as-zero). [Silver Pines](../../dm/games/0100D5B026844000/README.md): the Team17 logo and the title screen's animated background, 1920x1080.
- **Check:** `t_movie_vpx` decodes synthetic VP8 and VP9 keyframes through the real decoder, checking NV12 and RGBA pixels and a truncated VP8 header.

### H.264 into an RGBA texture and AAC through AudioToolbox

- H.264 (type 1) into the client's NVN texture (output 3 = RGBA, mode 2), with AAC 5.1 sound (type 4, PCM16). VideoToolbox decodes to BGRA for that mode (`mavc_set_rgba`), and AAC goes through AudioToolbox's converter with an MPEG-4 ES descriptor built from the AudioSpecificConfig in `csd-0` (as FFmpeg's AudioToolbox decoder does). Found on [Monster Hunter Rise](../../dm/games/0100B04011742000/README.md); its end-of-stream packets and decoder deletes are in [End-of-stream packets with no data, and deleted decoders](#end-of-stream-packets-with-no-data-and-deleted-decoders).

### Vorbis movie sound

- Movie sound in [The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening](../../dm/games/01006BB00C6F0000/README.md) (SDK 8.2.0): the decoder is asked for type 5 (Vorbis) with output format 1 (PCM16); see the other entries in this file and `hle_movie.c`.

### Vorbis output lengths at a window change

- **Symptom:** a movie with a Vorbis track starts clean, then crackles and stutters. The log has no underrun and no red line, and with `DM_AUDIO_DUMP` the game's mix has exact zeros in whole 512-sample blocks (mostly one or two at a time, 11 to 21 ms).
- **Cause:** at a change of window size `stb_vorbis` splits the samples differently from the specification: it ends a packet's samples at its window's `right_start`, which depends on the next window, not at the window's centre. With blocksizes 256 / 2048, a long window before a short one gave 1,472 samples instead of 1,024, and the short one 128 instead of 576. The total is the same, but those outputs did not match the distance to the next packet's time.
- **Fix:** `md_vorbis` keeps the decoded samples and each packet leaves with (previous blocksize + its blocksize) / 4 of them, the rest going with the next. The blocksizes come from the packets' mode numbers. Samples still kept after the last packet lie past the centre of its window, where the specification has none, so they are dropped. Handing out longer merged outputs instead was tried and made the sound much worse: the game's buffers are 8,192 bytes, and the outputs no longer matched the packets' times.
- **Found on:** [Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](../../dm/games/01006A800016E000/README.md) (13.0.5, Mac: [#768](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative/issues/768)).

### Vorbis sound stops for good after a Flush

- **Symptom:** a movie with a Vorbis track plays its first seconds with sound; after the game flushes and restarts it (a seek, a loop, or the app losing and regaining focus) the picture goes on but the sound does not come back, for the rest of the movie. The log shows `[movie] Flush`, `Flush`, `Start`, `Start` and no more `GetOutputBuffer … → PCM` lines. With `DM_AUDIO_DUMP`, the game's mix is real audio up to the flush and exact zeros from then on, so the AudioUnit is not at fault (0 underruns).
- **Cause:** `h_movie_Flush` called `stb_vorbis_flush_pushdata` on the Vorbis decoder, which puts it into its page search mode. The packets `md_vorbis` hands it afterwards (each wrapped as one whole Ogg page) gave no sample: in a test on a generated stream, none of the next 100 packets did, whether the stream went on or started again from its first packet.
- **Fix:** a Flush closes the Vorbis decoder, and the next packet opens it again from the headers (`md_vorbis_open`), as at the start of a stream. `t_movie_vpx` builds a small Vorbis stream, flushes twice and checks that the same samples come again.
- **Found on:** [Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](../../dm/games/01006A800016E000/README.md) (13.0.5, iPhone: the opening movie, after the app lost focus once. [#505](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative/issues/505) reported the same silence and was closed after a reinstall, with the app having been backgrounded once in the silent session).

## The Switch 2's decoder API

### `nn::codec` video decoders taken over

- **Symptom:** a Switch 2 game crashes when a movie starts: `nn::codec::video::Initialize` faults in the SDK (Donkey Kong Bananza: `sdk+0x2de99c`, after its first punch, when the guide movie starts), and before that `nv::InitCheck` aborts ([`hle_nv.c`](../../dm/gfx/hle_nv.c)). Later, when a second movie starts: `game called nn::diag abort: Result 0` in `nn::os::ClearSystemEvent` or `TryWaitSystemEvent` on the decoder's event.
- **Cause:** the Switch 2's SDK decodes video through `nn::codec` (H.264, AV1, VP8, VP9 decoders over a decoder service, decoder image pools, NV12 / RGBA readback), not `movie::Decoder`; every call goes to a service the host does not serve.
- **Fix:** `dm/host/hle_codec_video.c` takes the API over: VP8 and VP9 decoded with libvpx (the YUV conversions of `hle_movie_yuv.c`, shared with `hle_movie.c`), H.264 with VideoToolbox (`hle_movie_avc.c`, its NV12 pictures kept as I420, the parameter sets an Initialize overload passes given to it first). The four decoder types (`Vp8`, `Vp9`, `H264`, `Av1DecoderType`) have one layout, their event at +8 in the SDK, so one host decoder serves them (`cv_dec_*`, each family's entry points by their SDK names), `Unregister…DecoderBuffer` included. The protocol as the SDK implements it (sdk 20.5.19 Ounce): one image pool per output picture, registered with the decoder under an index; registering puts the index in an 8-deep queue of acquirable buffers with a signalled sync handle. `Release…OutputBuffer` gives the buffer to the decoder to fill and puts it back in the queue at once, with a new sync handle that signals when a picture is in it; `Acquire…OutputBuffer` takes the oldest (description 3604 when the queue is empty). `Get…OutputBufferProperties` gives size, time and end of stream once the buffer is filled (3604 until then). `Submit…InputBuffer` takes a packet (3603 while the decoder cannot take more, the client retries after the submission-ready event). On the host, packets decode on the submitting thread; pictures go into released buffers in release order, up to 4 wait for one. The sync handles are the host's (16 bytes: magic, decoder, index, generation): `nn::gs::TryWaitNativeSync` answers them, and so do sync point events (`nn::syncpt::sdk`, whose library the graphics initialisation sets up, which the host replaces: `CreateSyncPointEvent` jumped through a null table). A sync point event holds a SystemEvent the host binds, linked into the client's MultiWait by the SDK's own `nn::os::InitializeMultiWaitHolder`, and is signalled when its buffer is filled. The decoder's submission-ready event lives in the decoder type and goes with the decoder: `FinalizeVp9Decoder` destroys it, as the SDK does. Kept, it stayed in the host's table of bound SystemEvents, so the next decoder made in the same memory, which the game had cleared, was not given an event, and `nn::os::ClearSystemEvent` / `TryWaitSystemEvent` aborted on the uninitialised one (Donkey Kong Bananza, about four minutes in, when its second movie starts: two `nn::diag` aborts with Result 0, from `main+0xe1a71c` and `main+0x18793a0`).
- **Check:** `make -C dm/host/tests GAME=<id> run` runs `t_codec_video` (AddressSanitizer and UBSan): the buffer queue and its results, sync handles and sync point events, NV12 / RGBA readback of a synthetic VP9 key frame, packets refused while 4 pictures wait, end of stream, flush, a pool finalized while its buffer is still registered, a decoder finalized and made again in the same cleared memory, a VP8 key frame, a 64×64 H.264 baseline key frame decoded by VideoToolbox (ffmpeg's libx264, SEI removed), an unregistered buffer and AV1's refused Initialize (the Mac host has no dav1d; AV1: [AV1 movies on SDK 22.2](#av1-movies-on-sdk-222-implemented-unverified-on-a-device)).
- **Found on:** [Donkey Kong Bananza](../../dm/games/040074A01BF12000/README.md): 101 guide movies (`Movie/*.webm`, VP9 960×540, no sound); its player reads the pictures as NV12 (`ReadDecoderOutputImageNv12`, output format 3).
- **Open:** encrypted input, native image handles (the GPU route of decoded pictures), alias pools and the readback of part of a picture are not served (each prints a red line once). No game here plays VP8 or H.264 through this API yet: those paths are checked by the test only. Donkey Kong Bananza's player imports all four decoders; its movies are VP9.

### SDK 21's `nn::codec` entry points

- **Symptom:** a Switch 2 game on SDK 21 aborts when a movie starts: `game called nn::diag abort: Result 0, call site sdk+0x32f998`, the call site inside `nn::codec::InitializeVp9DecoderByTransferMemory` (Mario Kart World 1.8.0, sdk 21.4.0, when the player teleports on the map, about 2.5 minutes into a session); no `[codec]` line before it.
- **Cause:** SDK 21 renamed the calls that make things: the decoders' Initialize overloads became `Initialize…DecoderByTransferMemory` (a work buffer) and `…ByRemoteMemory` (none), each with an output mode; `MakeDecodeImagePreference` takes an `ImageTilingMode` and writes a 0x40-byte preference; `InitializeDecoderImagePool` lost its `CodecMode`; `Get…DecoderSubmissionReadyEvent` returns the event (the type's +8) instead of writing it out; the `Calculate…DecoderWorkBuffer` calls are gone and the decoder types are 0x260 bytes. The rest (Register, Acquire, Release, Submit, Finalize, the reads) kept their names. With only the 20.5 names taken over ([`nn::codec` video decoders taken over](#nncodec-video-decoders-taken-over)), the SDK's own Initialize ran, asked the decoder service the host does not serve, and the SDK aborted on its result (0x106c6f).
- **Fix:** `dm/host/hle_codec_video.c` takes the SDK 21 names over too and maps them onto the same host decoder (VP9, VP8, H.264; AV1 since [AV1 movies on SDK 22.2](#av1-movies-on-sdk-222-implemented-unverified-on-a-device), in hosts built with dav1d), pool and returned event; `InitializeDecoderAliasImagePool` fails with a red line (alias pools, the GPU route, are not served: before, the pool kept whatever was at its +0) and the HDR reads (`ReadDecoderOutputImageRgbaHdr`, `…HdrFloat`) clear their output with a red line. Arguments on the stack are taken as 64-bit slots, as the guest passes them under AAPCS64; Apple's arm64 ABI packs narrower ones, which made the existing H.264 Initialize with an output mode read its parameter sets from the wrong slot on the Mac (fixed with it).
- **Check:** `t_codec_video` (SDK 21 block): preference in a 0x40-byte slot, pool, `ByTransferMemory` and `ByRemoteMemory`, the returned event, a VP9 picture round trip, AV1's and the alias pool's refusals.
- **Found on:** [Mario Kart World](../../dm/games/0400C3F00006E000/README.md) 1.8.0, a user session on the phone (2026-11-03): the abort at a teleport on the map.
- **Open:** the teleport itself not yet replayed with the fix (the scripted runs do not reach it); HDR reads and alias pools.

### SDK 19.3's output properties with a colour space

- **Symptom:** a Switch 2 game on SDK 19.3 aborts right after its first decoded movie picture: `[codec] VP9 decoder 1: first picture 640x360 into buffer 0`, then `SVC 0x21 x0=0x56436d44 … (placeholder returns success)` and `game called nn::diag abort: Result 0, call site sdk+0x141e2c`.
- **Cause:** SDK 19.3 has only one overload of `Get{Vp9,Vp8,H264,Av1}DecoderOutputBufferProperties`, with an `nn::movie::ColorSpace *` before the time (`…PNS_5movie10ColorSpaceEPNS_8TimeSpanEPb…j`: nine arguments, the buffer index a 32-bit word on the stack). The host took over only the overload without it, so the SDK's own body ran. That body (sdk `90ebba18…` +0x2ca110, then +0x2ca800) answers from a cache of 0x30-byte records at type+0x120, one per buffer. Otherwise it sends TIPC 213 (the next finished picture: buffer slot, size, crop size, colour space, time, end of stream) on the session handle in the decoder type's first word. The host decoder's magic is there, so that is SendSyncRequest on `0x56436d44` ('DmCV'). The SVC placeholder answers with success and an unchanged message buffer, and the SDK's IPC layer aborts on the reply. Failing the call would only move the abort, since the caller treats any error as fatal: main `9e244438…` +0x19e8110 dispatches on the decoder kind, then `cbnz w0` into `nn::diag::detail::AbortImpl`.
- **Fix:** `dm/host/hle_codec_video.c` takes over the colour-space overloads for VP9, VP8 and H.264 (`cv_dec_props_cs`). They give the same answer from the host decoder as the other overload (size, crop size, time, end of stream; 3604 with no output written until the buffer holds a picture), plus the colour space. The numeric values of `nn::movie::ColorSpace` are not known. No SDK header is available. The SDK copies the server's word into its cache unchanged, so it has no client-side conversion to read them from. The NX 22.5.0 firmware has no graphics-server video decoder. The host writes 0 and prints a red line once with the stream's colour space and range from libvpx. Mario Kart World's player zeroes the variable before the call and never reads it back: main +0x19e63b4 / +0x19e63d4 and +0x19e701c / +0x19e702c are the dispatcher's only two callers, and the second reads only the crop size. So no picture it shows depends on the value. AV1's overload is taken over too since AV1 is decoded ([AV1 movies on SDK 22.2](#av1-movies-on-sdk-222-implemented-unverified-on-a-device)).
- **Check:** `python3 -m unittest dm.tools.tests.test_codec_poll` (Linux, AddressSanitizer and UBSan, the codec source with a POSIX shim). An invalid decoder or index (2004) and an unfilled buffer (3604) leave every output untouched. A filled buffer writes them all, with the colour space 0, for the three codecs. The test also checks the nine-argument type. `t_codec_video` (Mac) checks the same on a decoded VP9 picture.
- **Found on:** [Mario Kart World](../../dm/games/0400C3F00006E000/README.md), registered build (SDK 19.3.3), on the phone: the 640x360 VP9 movie, about 160 s into a Time Trial race (72 s into an earlier run). With the fix, its movies decode and loop (4,200 pictures in one session) without an abort.
- **Open:** the `nn::movie::ColorSpace` values (a player that converts colour by them would need them).

### AV1 movies on SDK 22.2 (implemented, unverified on a device)

- **Symptom:** a Switch 2 game on SDK 22.x aborts when its first AV1 movie starts: the movie library's `movie::detail::InitializeDecoderByTransferMemory` / `…ByRemoteMemory` (subsdk0 +0xf900 / +0xf9c0) aborts with the result the host's AV1 Initialize returns (`[RED] nn::codec AV1 decoder: no AV1 decoder in this host build (NX_DAV1D), Initialize fails`, description 2004; only description 2003 of `…ByRemoteMemory` is taken as "unsupported" and returned to the caller). Before the fix the line read `no AV1 decoder on the host`; a host built without dav1d (the Mac, iOS, an Android host built with `-PnxAv1Dav1d=false`) still prints it.
- **Cause:** the host had no AV1 decoder. Zelda: Ocarina of Time's 26 `Event/Movie/*.webm` are AV1 Main 8-bit 4:2:0, 1920x1080 at 60 fps, BT.709 limited range (sRGB transfer), no film grain, no audio track, 1.4 GB in all (1,394 s, 83,630 pictures; `ffprobe` and `trace_headers` over all 26). The WebM demuxing is the guest's (the SDK holds the Matroska extractor), the packets are one temporal unit each without a temporal delimiter, and the first packet of every key frame carries the sequence header. The game's player (main +0x3b5f08c…) asks `movie::VideoDecoder` for NV12 pictures in plain buffers (output format 3, pixel storage type 1, w*h*3/2 bytes a frame): `ReadDecoderOutputImageNv12`, the route the host already served for VP9. The wrapper in subsdk0 dispatches on the decoder kind at +0x400 (0 H.264, 1 VP9, 3 AV1, 4 VP8) to the SDK's `nn::codec` calls. All 14 AV1 entry points are exports of the sdk module (`1643a838…`), called from subsdk0 and never from main; every one but Acquire (answered from a ring in the type) sends an IPC message to the decoder service on the handle in the type's first word, so all 14 have to be taken over. SDK 22.2 has the SDK 21 shape: `InitializeAv1DecoderByTransferMemory` (+0x330530) / `…ByRemoteMemory` (+0x3306a0), both clearing a 0x260-byte type, `GetAv1DecoderSubmissionReadyEvent` returning the type's +8 (+0x330a90), `GetAv1DecoderOutputBufferProperties` without a colour space (+0x330ca0), no `Calculate…WorkBuffer`. Proven by disassembly of these modules; that the other calls behave as VP9's is inferred from the shared wrapper and types.
- **Fix:** `dm/host/hle_codec_video.c` serves AV1 with the same host decoder as VP9 (`CV_FAMILY(av1, …)`, `CV_INIT21(av1, …)`, `CV_PROPS_CS(av1, …)` for an SDK that has that overload; all 14 names of SDK 22.2.8 are in the host's take-over table, checked against the sdk module's exports) and decodes with dav1d 1.5.4 ([dm/third_party/dav1d](../../dm/third_party/dav1d/README.md), BSD-2-Clause) through `dm/host/hle_av1_dav1d.c` (a temporal unit in, I420 pictures out, drain, flush). Built into the Android host by default (`NX_AV1_DAV1D`, on when the sources are in the tree; Gradle `-PnxAv1Dav1d=false` leaves it out); without it AV1 Initialize fails as before. How it differs from VP9: dav1d's frame threads give a picture later than the packet that made it, so pictures are taken from dav1d whenever the host hands pictures to buffers (Submit and Release, `av1_pull`), each with the time dav1d carried with its unit (not the time of the call that returned it), and the end of stream goes on the last picture dav1d gives once it has drained. A Flush or Stop flushes dav1d, which restarts at the next key frame (whose packet carries the sequence header). The pictures are copied into the pool's I420 images (with the stream's colour space and range: here BT.709, limited) and converted to NV12 by `md_nv12` (now in `hle_movie_yuv.c`), as VP9's. Threads: `DM_AV1_THREADS` (default 2, `0` dav1d's choice, at most 8), frame delay 2 (1 with one thread): 1080p60 is heavy for a phone's CPU (3 to 6 ms a picture on one Ryzen 9 7950X core with dav1d's x86 assembly, estimated 8 to 22 ms on one phone core with its NEON code), and the GPU-bound game needs the power budget. With one thread dav1d decodes on the caller's thread, so AV1's Submit and Release run on the host's big stack (`HLE_FORCE_BIG`). No picture is dropped: each is a reference for the next (dav1d decodes them all anyway) and the player waits for every buffer it released by index and sync handle, so a skipped picture would only stall it. The colour space of the properties overload that has one is answered 0 with a red line, as for the other codecs (no player here reads it); SDK 22.2.8 has no such overload for AV1. libnxhost.so grows by 631 KB stripped (Mario Kart World profile: 2,348,952 to 2,980,216 bytes; text +628 KB). A game that never makes an AV1 decoder runs no new code.
- **Check:** `python3 -m unittest dm.tools.tests.test_codec_av1` (Linux, AddressSanitizer and UBSan: the production `hle_codec_video.c` behind `test_codec_poll`'s shim, dav1d's C code, the real `md_nv12`). It drives the take-overs as the movie library calls them, on clips made on the spot (ffmpeg, BT.709 limited range, hidden frames): 320x180 (60 pictures, two key frames) and 1920x1080 (12 pictures). It covers both Initialize overloads, 0 / 1 / 2 / 4 threads, the returned event, 3604 with nothing written before a buffer holds a picture, every NV12 picture identical to ffmpeg's libdav1d in Y and UV (into one buffer and into two), times in display order, end of stream on the last picture, the colour-space overload, a Flush in the middle and a Stop then the stream again, a garbage packet, 3603 with the event cleared while 4 pictures wait, invalid indices, encrypted input and Finalize with pictures waiting. `dm.tools.tests.test_av1_dav1d` checks the wrapper alone; by hand, 90 packets each of three of the game's own movies decoded identically to ffmpeg's dav1d.
- **On a device (2026-11-06):** Ocarina of Time's title movie on the AYN Thor (Snapdragon 8 Gen 2): the game takes the by-transfer-memory Initialize; pictures are presented at 59.7 fps, dav1d's two workers at 26 to 28.5% of a core each (about 9 ms of CPU a picture); a second decoder made after the title, no `[RED] nn::codec` line ([its note](../../dm/games/0400486024DEC000/README.md#boot-android)). The heading keeps its old anchor, which other pages link.

- **Open:** not run on a device yet. The first boot shows which Initialize overload the game takes (`[codec] AV1 decoder 1: 1920x1080, input format N, output format 3, by transfer memory | by remote memory (dav1d, 2 thread(s) on the host)`), the real decode time and heat at 1080p60 on the phone, and whether the title screen's loop plays (a Flush or Stop, then a new first picture). The hardware path (MediaCodec `video/av01`, `c2.qti.av1.decoder` if the phone has one) is the next step for heat; 10-bit streams (this dav1d build is 8-bit: such pictures are dropped with a red line), and the `nn::movie::ColorSpace` values of an SDK that has the colour-space overload for AV1.

## Movie players

### Unity's video planes and checking the movie path

- Unity's `Hidden/VideoDecode` samples luma as `.w` of an `R8` texture with the swizzle `(0, 0, 0, R)` (Unity's Alpha8) and chroma from an `RG8` texture at half size; both are CPU-written block-linear textures ([nvn-objects.md](nvn-objects.md)).
- **Check:** to check the movie path apart from the decoder, fill the frames with a gradient in `hle_movie.c`; it should appear on screen.
